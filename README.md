# Vollda is an old-style text typeface with a serious mood and modern latin-based cyrillic
- Suitable for business topics
- Vollda is based on the Vollkorn typeface (vollkorn-typeface.com), SIL license 1.1
- Only Bold style is available right now


## Why the heck?

- I wanted to add a more serious mood so I redesigned "a" in a Granjon style.
The original "a" of Vollkorn looked kinda bulky and playful to me
- Cyrillic "К, Ж, Я" looked a way too historic so I redesigned them to be more contemporary
and latin-based (in the same time having more resemblance to the latin original "K, R")
