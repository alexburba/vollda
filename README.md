Vollda is a old-style text typeface based on the Vollkorn typeface (vollkorn-typeface.com)

Why the heck?
1. I wanted to add more a strict mood so I redesigned "a" in Granjon style.
The original "a" of Vollkorn looked kinda bulky and playful to me.

2.On behalf of cyrillics — I wanted it to be less old-style cyrillic ("к,л,я")
but more humanistic and latin-based so I redesigned "к,л,я"
