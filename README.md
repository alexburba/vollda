# Vollda is an old-style text typeface with a serious mood and contemporary feel
- Suitable for business topics
- Vollda is based on the [Vollkorn typeface](https://github.com/FAlthausen/Vollkorn-Typeface), SIL license 1.1
- Only Bold style is available right now


## Why the heck Vollda if we have a high-quality Vollkorn?
- The original "a" of Vollkorn looked kinda playful and too bulky for my needs.
So to add a more serious mood I redesigned "a" in a slight Granjon style.
Obviously, it led to editing "u,d,b,p,q" and then "n,m,h".
- Cyrillic "Кк, Жж, Яя" looked a way too historic (poluustav-ish)
so I redesigned them to appear more contemporary and in the same time
having more resemblance to the latin original "K, R"
- Thirdly, cyrillic "б,ф" looked okay, but the their skeletons were a bit outdated,
so I tweaked them a bit to get that modern feel.
- And finally, I deleted internal rounded corners in Cyrillic "Пп, Дд, Лл, Цц, Щщ, Шш",
because those rounded corners might have appeared only during some old letter press printing.
That is not what you get when you try to write them with an 6.0mm nib or print them on a laser printer.
